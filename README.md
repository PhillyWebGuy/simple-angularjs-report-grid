# simple-angularjs-report-grid
This is a simple AngularJS report grid demo solution.

The purpose of this code is to show how AngularJS can be used, along with [http://ui-grid.info/](Angular Grid UI), to produce a simple grid.

This demo includes an HTML page with a form that makes use of AngularJS to pass a query string to a local endpoint, which retrieves static JSON, then passes the JSON object to Angular Grid UI in order to demonstrate how a sortable grid may be implemented quickly.

The following dependcies are included in the HEAD of the sample HTML page. The source of the scripts and/or being located on CDNs.

1. AngularJS 1.4.3
2. Angular UI Grid 3.0.7
3. JQuery 1.10.2
4. JQuery UI 1.11.4
5. Bootstrap 3.3.5

The sample JSON data was generated at [http://www.json-generator.com/](http://www.json-generator.com/)
